## 🚀 Usage

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Power On**: Connect the Arduino to a power source (USB or 5V adapter)
2. **Initial Display**: LCD shows "Scan your card"
3. **Add Products**: 
   - Place RFID-tagged products near the reader
   - Product name and price appear on LCD
   - Total amount is calculated automatically
4. **Checkout**: 
   - Scan the checkout card
   - LCD displays "Checkout Done" and total bill
   - System auto-resets after 2 seconds
5. **Next Customer**: System is ready for the next transaction

### Adding New Products

To add more products to the system:

1. Obtain the RFID UID using `RFID_Card_Reader.ino`
2. Edit `Smart_Shopping_Trolley_Billing.ino`:

```cpp
// Increase array size
String cardUIDs[5] = {
  "EF 69 35 1E",  // Milk
  "F3 AB DD E2",  // Bread
  "63 97 60 E4",  // Juice
  "XX XX XX XX",  // New Product
  "97 8B 7A 00"   // Checkout (always last)
};

String productNames[4] = {"Milk", "Bread", "Juice", "NewProduct"};
int productPrices[4] = {30, 20, 25, 50};
bool productScanned[4] = {false, false, false, false};
```

3. Update loop limits from `3` to `4` in the code
4. Re-upload to Arduino
